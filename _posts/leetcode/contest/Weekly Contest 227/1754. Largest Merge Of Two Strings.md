### 1754. Largest Merge Of Two Strings

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2` are non-empty, choose **one** of the following options:

- If

  ```
  word1
  ```

   

  is non-empty, append the

   

  first

   

  character in

   

  ```
  word1
  ```

   

  to

   

  ```
  merge
  ```

   

  and delete it from

   

  ```
  word1
  ```

  .

  - For example, if `word1 = "abc" `and `merge = "dv"`, then after choosing this operation, `word1 = "bc"` and `merge = "dva"`.

- If

   

  ```
  word2
  ```

   

  is non-empty, append the

   

  first

   

  character in

   

  ```
  word2
  ```

   

  to

   

  ```
  merge
  ```

   

  and delete it from

   

  ```
  word2
  ```

  .

  - For example, if `word2 = "abc" `and `merge = ""`, then after choosing this operation, `word2 = "bc"` and `merge = "a"`.

Return *the lexicographically **largest*** `merge` *you can construct*.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `"abcd"` is lexicographically larger than `"abcc"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "cabaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = "c", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cb", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "caaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cbc", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbca", word1 = "baa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbcab", word1 = "aa", word2 = "aaa"
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abdcaba"
Output: "abdcabcabcaba"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000`
- `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.







### My solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string largestMerge(string word1, string word2) {
        string res = "";
        while(word1.length() > 0 && word2.length() > 0){
            string tmp;
            if(word1> word2){
                tmp = word1[0];
                word1.erase(0,1);
            }
            else{
                tmp =  word2[0];
                word2.erase(0,1);
            }
            res += tmp;
        }
        // return res;
        if(word1.length() > 0){
            res += word1;
        }
        if(word2.length() > 0){
            res += word2;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```





### Better solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string largestMerge(string word1, string word2) {
        string res = "";
        while(word1.length() > 0 && word2.length() > 0){
            if(word1> word2){
                res += word1[0];
                word1.erase(0,1);
            }
            else{
                res +=  word2[0];
                word2.erase(0,1);
            }
        }
        res += word1 + word2;
        return res;
    }
};
```
